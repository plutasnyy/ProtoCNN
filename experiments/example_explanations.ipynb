and the tacky overly preachy whiny and stilted screenplay by f. mathew smith i really despise the fact that it sends a very pro mormon and sort of anti every other religion message yes the story is about a small town half full with mormons and half full with baptists it shows all the main and role model characters being mormon and being so nice and perfect yet they are being picked on by the evil conniving and very judgmental baptists it shows how beautiful mormons are and how cold hearted and ignorant baptists are instead of showing a little solidarity like would be appropriate and realistic i &#x27;m a part of neither religion i &#x27;m actually an atheist but this offended me along with another countless amount of baptists most likely it shows the baptists as being very &lt;unk&gt; and unwelcoming to the mormons and the mormons being very accepting when again in reality there is a mutual like dislike between them sorry i did n&#x27;t mean to go off on a &lt;unk&gt; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;another aspect of baptists at our barbecue i did n&#x27;t much care for was the acting the performances are very amateurish and unnatural especially from the female lead heather beers miss beers stumbles her way through her part without any passion or feeling for her role and i was n&#x27;t too much impressed with dan &lt;unk&gt; who &#x27;s the main character in this lackluster of a motion picture but i have to say he &#x27;s way more talented or shows more talent in this film then heather beers whoever played the town sheriff was awful also although there is maybe a tiny laugh deep within the film it is full of clichés for example the main character &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; finds solace with a native american who always gives him the best advice on things relating to a tribal way of life how cliché is that to make the situation even more of a pathetic cliché &lt;unk&gt; buys the poor lonely &lt;unk&gt; a puppy dog ugghhh br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you want my advice stay as far away from baptists at our barbecue as you can i saw it on the shelf and thought it would be a cute and interesting little indie about religion all i got was a well piece of crap grade d-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my ratings guide a+ absolutley flawless a a masterpiece near perfect a- excellent b+ great b very good b- good c+ a mixed bag c average c- disappointing d+ bad d very bad d- absolutley horrendous f not one redeeming quality in this hunk of hollywood feces <br><br><b>Prediction</b>: Negative, <b>Gold standard</b>: Negative<br><br>Evidence for Negative sentiment:<br><table style=\"width:800px\"><tr><td><b>Most similar phrase</b></td><td><b>Prototype</b></td><td><b>Similarity * Weight</b></td></tr><tr><td><span\">amateurish and unnatural especially from </span> </td> <td> leaden amateurish effort for someone </td> <td>4.03 * 0.81 = <b>3.28</b></td></tr><tr><td><span\">of this tacky offensive pretentious </span> </td> <td> procedure a waste of time </td> <td>3.13 * 0.84 = <b>2.64</b></td></tr><tr><td><span\">of crap grade d-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br </span> </td> <td> this piece of garbage sure </td> <td>3.32 * 0.59 = <b>1.97</b></td></tr></table>Sum of evidence: <b>9.84</b><br><br>Evidence for Positive sentiment:<br><table style=\"width:800px\"><tr><td><b>Most similar phrase</b></td><td><b>Prototype</b></td><td><b>Similarity * Weight</b></td></tr><tr><td><span\">very good b- good c+ </span> </td> <td> is an amazing film that </td> <td>3.04 * 0.61 = <b>1.86</b></td></tr><tr><td><span\">b very good b- good </span> </td> <td> perfect blend of sports nut </td> <td>2.49 * 0.72 = <b>1.79</b></td></tr><tr><td><span\">nice and perfect yet they </span> </td> <td> /&gt;it &#x27;s a brilliant crushing </td> <td>2.39 * 0.74 = <b>1.78</b></td></tr></table>Sum of evidence: <b>6.32</b><br><br><br><br><b>Input example</b>: at first i did n&#x27;t like the movie cause of it being a nazi swastika drama but after buying it and seeing it it was n&#x27;t that bad i heard so many complaints about the numbers being short and &lt;unk&gt; werner not singing now i understand the radio show was a super propaganda radio program &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and zara plus rudy &lt;unk&gt; and band like kurt &lt;unk&gt; and his orchestra and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ex cetera never appeared in the radio show cause the singers and the bands were of the pop jazz and swing categories the club foot had that regulated that for touring occupied areas for the soldiers to short wave radios for the soldiers also night clubs and hotels in berlin and hamburg and record sales only this is why &lt;unk&gt; was n&#x27;t allowed to sing in this picture this would be made up by medium budget musical were making music 1942 in which she would demonstrate her whistling but this is an excellent example propaganda inge and her aunt &lt;unk&gt; played by ida wust goes to the 1936 olympics the aunt forgets her tickets so inge has to wait till her aunt comes back with the tickets she meets &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; who plays herbert who has an extra ticket she goes with him and it &#x27;s love at first sight they plan to marry but the spanish war get in the way so he has to go on an assignment against the right side carl &lt;unk&gt; as so many people complained about him was really handsome and not plain when he did &lt;unk&gt; and they put a mustache on him plus his own &lt;unk&gt; that made him plain looking you see the nazi soldiers acting normal like a scene in which a ex butcher and his troops are in france and they steal pigs from a farm and they are about to make lunch until their leader suggest to save the pigs this reflect &lt;unk&gt; animal rights extremism the character was a butcher now soldier this was a subtle put down against meat eating late on in world war 11 herbert is flying in a german airplane we shoot one of the pilots so herbert takes over we shoot his plane they crash unfortunately for us they survive another seen the nazis soldiers go in a bomb catholic church now it &#x27;s putting the catholics down and hubert &#x27;s best friend helmet played by joachim &lt;unk&gt; starts to play the organ &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; bombs come in from us the church is bomb more the soldier continues to stay and play the organ he &#x27;s being told to leave we end up injuring him propaganda message the catholic church organ cause him to become addicted to it it injured him see by this time inge is with her either mother or grandma played hedwig &lt;unk&gt; the same german &lt;unk&gt; actress who played maria &lt;unk&gt; &#x27;s aunt in weiner &lt;unk&gt; well later it comes to the short view of the radio show this was not intended to be a musical revue such as &lt;unk&gt; terry released that same year were as well as &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; the music as well as their side of the war was so supposed to be only the back drop it was mainly a war romantic movie it &#x27;s easy to take a pot shot at those soldier in the movie but in real life many of those soldiers were being forced to fight the nazi cause cause of the job and the monthly pay that they would receive after the war many of them who survive would regret it this is a good swastika classic the only problem is that today you have neo nazi and nazi skin heads who watched the same movies to reflect their hitler worship and their they have disturbing websites who exploit these film classics to raise money for their insanity be careful most of the time it &#x27;s the direct hate only classics if their scenario looks like they are glorifying it then its a nazi website skip it &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; or german wartime films dot com amazon dot dee or german video dot net they are legitimate &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; a mistake it was n&#x27;t herbert &#x27;s friend that got killed at the church it was &lt;unk&gt;
